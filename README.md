# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard  

üìå **Project Objective**  
To design and develop a **Road Accident Dashboard in Power BI** for the years 2021 and 2022 that delivers detailed insights into total accidents, casualties, accident severity, vehicle type analysis, road conditions, and location-based hotspots.   

The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor KPIs, track accident severity trends, analyze road-type and vehicle-type contributions, and make **data-driven decisions** to improve road safety, traffic management, and public awareness initiatives.

üìä **Live Dashboard**  
I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize **Road Accident Insights**.  
üîó You can explore it **Live** here: [View Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjUxMzRlNzMtODRlOC00ZWY1LTk5MTEtMTQ3YzFkMmNlOTczIiwidCI6ImNhZDFhYWU2LTc3MjEtNGE2Yy05ZWM3LWY1MWQ4YTJkYjY5NiJ9)

üö® **Business Problem**  
Road accidents remain one of the leading causes of injuries and fatalities every year. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:  

- Monitor **total casualties and accidents** for current vs previous year  
- Track **severity-wise casualties** (fatal, serious, slight)  
- Compare **monthly accident trends** across years  
- Understand **vehicle-type contributions** to road accidents  
- Evaluate **road-type accident risks** (single carriageway, dual carriageway, etc.)  
- Analyze accidents by **urban vs rural areas**  
- Study **time-based patterns** (day vs night, light conditions)  
- Identify **geographic hotspots** for targeted safety measures  

---

‚ùì **Key Questions (KPIs)**  

- What are the **total casualties and accidents** this year compared to last year?  
- How do casualties differ by **severity** (fatal, serious, slight)?  
- What is the **distribution of casualties by vehicle type**?  
- How do casualties trend **monthly** across 2021 and 2022?  
- Which **road types** report the most casualties?  
- How do **urban vs rural areas** contribute to total casualties?  
- How does **day vs night driving** impact accident rates?  
- Which **locations** have the highest number of casualties?  

---

‚öôÔ∏è **Process**  

- **Data Import & Cleaning**: Imported accident data for 2021‚Äì2022 into Power BI and cleaned inconsistencies using Power Query.  
- **Data Transformation**: Created calculated columns and DAX measures for KPIs such as YoY growth, severity breakdown, and road-type metrics.  
- **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between fact tables (accidents) and dimension tables (vehicle type, location, road type, conditions).  
- **Visualization Setup**:  
  - **KPI Cards** ‚Äì Total Casualties, Total Accidents, Fatal, Serious & Slight Casualties  
  - **Line Chart** ‚Äì Monthly accident trend comparison (CY vs PY)  
  - **Donut Charts** ‚Äì Urban vs Rural distribution, Day vs Night conditions  
  - **Bar Charts** ‚Äì Casualties by Vehicle Type & Road Type  
  - **Map Visualization** ‚Äì Geographic hotspots of accidents  
- **Dashboard Design**: Built with a professional dark-themed layout and added filters for **Road Surface** and **Weather Conditions**.

üîé **Project Insights**  

- **Accident Reduction**: Both casualties and accidents decreased YoY, but fatal casualties saw the steepest drop (-33.3%).  
- **Vehicle Analysis**: Cars are the most accident-prone, demanding stricter safety regulations.  
- **Road Safety**: Single carriageways are the riskiest and require infrastructure improvements.  
- **Time Patterns**: Most accidents occur during the **day**, breaking the assumption that night driving is riskier.  
- **Urban Focus**: Majority of accidents are in **urban areas**, indicating higher traffic congestion issues.  

---

‚úÖ **Final Conclusion**  

- **Urban Safety Measures**: Strengthen enforcement in urban areas where most accidents occur.  
- **Vehicle Policy**: Focus road safety campaigns on **cars and vans**, the leading contributors.  
- **Infrastructure Needs**: Redesign and improve **single carriageways** to reduce risk.  
- **Daytime Awareness**: Launch awareness programs for **daytime drivers**, not just night-time.  
- **Hotspot Targeting**: Deploy **traffic control measures** in high-casualty regions identified by mapping.
