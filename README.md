# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard  

📌 **Project Objective**  
To design and develop a **Road Accident Dashboard in Power BI** for the years 2021 and 2022 that delivers detailed insights into total accidents, casualties, accident severity, vehicle type analysis, road conditions, and location-based hotspots.  

The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor KPIs, track accident severity trends, analyze road-type and vehicle-type contributions, and make **data-driven decisions** to improve road safety, traffic management, and public awareness initiatives.

📊 **Live Dashboard**  
I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize **Road Accident Insights**.

🚨 **Business Problem**  
Road accidents remain one of the leading causes of injuries and fatalities every year. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:  

- Monitor **total casualties and accidents** for current vs previous year  
- Track **severity-wise casualties** (fatal, serious, slight)  
- Compare **monthly accident trends** across years  
- Understand **vehicle-type contributions** to road accidents  
- Evaluate **road-type accident risks** (single carriageway, dual carriageway, etc.)  
- Analyze accidents by **urban vs rural areas**  
- Study **time-based patterns** (day vs night, light conditions)  
- Identify **geographic hotspots** for targeted safety measures  

---

❓ **Key Questions (KPIs)**  

- What are the **total casualties and accidents** this year compared to last year?  
- How do casualties differ by **severity** (fatal, serious, slight)?  
- What is the **distribution of casualties by vehicle type**?  
- How do casualties trend **monthly** across 2021 and 2022?  
- Which **road types** report the most casualties?  
- How do **urban vs rural areas** contribute to total casualties?  
- How does **day vs night driving** impact accident rates?  
- Which **locations** have the highest number of casualties?

⚙️ **Process**  

- **Data Import & Cleaning**: Imported accident data for 2021–2022 into Power BI and cleaned inconsistencies using Power Query.  
- **Data Transformation**: Created calculated columns and DAX measures for KPIs such as YoY growth, severity breakdown, and road-type metrics.  
- **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between fact tables (accidents) and dimension tables (vehicle type, location, road type, conditions).  
- **Visualization Setup**:  
  - **KPI Cards** – Total Casualties, Total Accidents, Fatal, Serious & Slight Casualties  
  - **Line Chart** – Monthly accident trend comparison (CY vs PY)  
  - **Donut Charts** – Urban vs Rural distribution, Day vs Night conditions  
  - **Bar Charts** – Casualties by Vehicle Type & Road Type  
  - **Map Visualization** – Geographic hotspots of accidents  
- **Dashboard Design**: Built with a professional dark-themed layout and added filters for **Road Surface** and **Weather Conditions**.

📊 **Dashboard**  
![Overview](https://github.com/KamalNayanTiwary/Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Snapshot%20of%20the%20Dashboard.png)  

- **Top-Level KPIs**:  
  - Total CY Casualties: **195.7K** (-11.9% YoY)  
  - Total CY Accidents: **144.4K** (-11.7% YoY)  
  - Fatal Casualties: **2.9K** (-33.3% YoY)  
  - Serious Casualties: **27K** (-16.2% YoY)  
  - Slight Casualties: **165.8K** (-10.6% YoY)  

- **Vehicle-Type Impact**:  
  - Cars: **155.8K casualties** (highest risk)  
  - Vans: **15.9K casualties**  
  - Bikes: **15.6K casualties**  
  - Buses & Agricultural vehicles contribute smaller shares.  

- **Road-Type Insights**:  
  - Single Carriageway: **145K casualties** (highest)  
  - Dual Carriageway: **32K casualties**  
  - Roundabouts & others: lower but significant.  

- **Geographic Distribution**:  
  - Urban areas: **61.95%**  
  - Rural areas: **38.05%**  

- **Time Factor**:  
  - Daytime: **73.84% casualties**  
  - Nighttime: **26.16% casualties**  

- **Hotspot Mapping**:  
  - Concentrated accidents across **UK regions**, clearly highlighting high-risk zones.  

---

🔎 **Project Insights**  

- **Accident Reduction**: Both casualties and accidents decreased YoY, but fatal casualties saw the steepest drop (-33.3%).  
- **Vehicle Analysis**: Cars are the most accident-prone, demanding stricter safety regulations.  
- **Road Safety**: Single carriageways are the riskiest and require infrastructure improvements.  
- **Time Patterns**: Most accidents occur during the **day**, breaking the assumption that night driving is riskier.  
- **Urban Focus**: Majority of accidents are in **urban areas**, indicating higher traffic congestion issues.  

---

✅ **Final Conclusion**  

- **Urban Safety Measures**: Strengthen enforcement in urban areas where most accidents occur.  
- **Vehicle Policy**: Focus road safety campaigns on **cars and vans**, the leading contributors.  
- **Infrastructure Needs**: Redesign and improve **single carriageways** to reduce risk.  
- **Daytime Awareness**: Launch awareness programs for **daytime drivers**, not just night-time.  
- **Hotspot Targeting**: Deploy **traffic control measures** in high-casualty regions identified by mapping.
